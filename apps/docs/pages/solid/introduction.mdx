# Solid

`@tw-classed/solid` is a library that allows you to create classed components in `Solid.js`. It has **1-1 API parity** with `@tw-classed/react`, but with Solid specific internals. Follow the [React guide](/docs/guide) to learn more about the API.

## Installation

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm", "yarn"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash 
    pnpm add @tw-classed/solid 
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash 
    npm i @tw-classed/solid 
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash 
    yarn add @tw-classed/solid 
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage

```js
import { classed } from "@tw-classed/solid";

const Button = classed.button("flex items-center", {
  variants: {
    size: {
      1: "px-2 py-1 text-sm",
      2: "px-4 py-2 text-base",
      3: "px-6 py-3 text-lg",
    },
    color: {
      blue: "bg-blue-300",
      red: "bg-red-300",
    },
  },
});
```

In your App

```jsx
() => (
  <Button size="2" color="blue" class="some-extra-classes..">
    Click me
  </Button>
);
```
