# Using `tw-classed` with React Native

While `tw-classed` is primarily designed for web development, it is also possible to use tw-classed with React Native to style your mobile applications. This documentation page will guide you through the process of setting up and using tw-classed with React Native.

## Install dependencies

Before getting started, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [React Native (>=0.70)](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
- [React (>=17.0.2)](https://reactjs.dev)
- [@tw-classed/react (>=1.4)](https://tw-classed.vercel.app)
- [nativewind](https://nativewind.dev)

## Setup

1. Import the necessary components and libraries in your React Native file:

```tsx
import { Text as RNText } from "react-native";
import { styled } from "nativewind";
import { classed } from "@tw-classed/react";
```

2. Create a styled component using nativewind:

```tsx
const StyledText = styled(RNText);
```

3. Export a classed component by combining the styled component with tw-classed:

```tsx
export const Text = classed(StyledText, {
  variants: {
    color: {
      blue: "text-blue-500",
      green: "text-green-500",
    },
  },
});
```

## Usage

You can now use the `Text` component the same way you would use it in a React web application

```tsx
import { Text } from "./path/to/Text";

const App = () => {
  return <Text color="blue">Hello, tw-classed!</Text>;
};
```
